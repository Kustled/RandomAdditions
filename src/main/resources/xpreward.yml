# This will set the XP reward that a player gets when
# killing an entity with a XP infused sword.
SWORD:
  # This counts the ratio of XP you get based on the max health attribute
  # of the entity the player killed. (Example: Using the default 5, the
  # player would get (entity_max_health) divided by 5 amount of XP. So
  # if an entity with max health being 100 is killed, they would get 20 XP.)
